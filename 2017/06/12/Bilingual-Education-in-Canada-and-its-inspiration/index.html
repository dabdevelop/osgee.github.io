        <h4 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h4><p>I was lucky to have an opportunity to go to Canada two years ago. In this article, I would like to share some interesting experience with you. I went to Ottawa, where I was impressed by the young boys and girls who can speak both English and French as good as native speakers. Then, I asked one man who sales maple honey in the street about how did they learn two languages in the same time. The ways they are educated are amazing and inspiring. To the contrary, China has put huge resources to educate teenagers in English, but the result is far from satisfying. So, I think it is time to rethink the English education in China.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h4 id="Body"><a href="#Body" class="headerlink" title="Body"></a>Body</h4><p>Canada is successful to implement bilingual education. As a young nation with much land and few people, Canada is founded by three main groups: Aboriginal people, French and the English colonists. Groups differ greatly from each other in population size, geographical distribution and cultures including languages and social activities. Canadians of British and French origin form the largest ethnic groups in Canada. In this circumstance, Canada has two official languages, English and French. About 22% of the Canadian population speaks French and 58.4% speaks English. However, most native French speakers in Canada live in Quebec. Quebec is a province of Canada, and it is the second-most populous province of Canada after Ontario and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. There are cultural disagreements between French and English ethnic groups. As a result of it, there are several referendums seeking for sovereignty and independence in Quebec’s history. Educational institutions in Quebec started bilingual education programs, which is also called Immersion Programs, to improve the cultural tolerance and develop sense of identity. After decades of hard work, bilingual education did help a lot for the unity of Canada and nurtured a huge number of bilinguals. In the meantime, Quebec has been very advanced in bilingual education especially in French Immersion Programs, which is inspiring for other educational institutions. McGill University, the world-renown university in Canada and the best university in Quebec, was the leader of immersion programs and started immersion programs in English and French in mid-1960s. The students in these immersion programs can use English or French just as good as their home language.  The research shows that learning a second language does not jeopardize their first language, just the opposite, learning a second language can bright students and improve their ability to learn a new language.</p>
<p>Immersion programs have different forms. Some programs use the second language as the instruction language in one or two semester, some programs only use the second language to instruct several subjects, and some programs even use the second language as the instruction language in most of the school years. Besides, according to the age of an individual begins to the Immersion program, the immersion programs are divided to Early Immersion (Kindergarten or Grade 1), Middle Immersion (Grade 4 or 5) and Late Immersion(Grade 6, 7, or 8). Some researches show that the earlier the students attend in the Immersion Program the quicker they learn the second language. Not only the Immersion Program can improve students academic performance, but also increase their chances of finding a good job. Students in Immersion Program can think problems in two perspectives. Learning a second language opens the students’ world to other culture and experiences. The skills and abilities they developed to learn the second language can enhance their skills and abilities in their first language. There is a concrete case that shows how French Immersion Programs is designed in Canada. The French Immersion Programs include Core French Program and Intensive French Program. Core French is compulsory for all students. Core French starts in Grade 4, and it has one period per day in French Instruction about 40-60 minutes. Core French will last until Grade 8 or 12. Intensive French Program has two kind of forms, Junior Extended French and Early French Immersion. In Junior Extended French, students have half day French and half day English. The French are used as the Instruction language in subjects like French, Arts and Social Studies. The English are used as the instruction language in subjects like English, Math, Science and Physics. Students in this programs can learn both English and French in their classes and they have to learn the terms in the other language which is not instructed by themselves after class. The other Intensive French Program is Early French Immersion. Not like Junior Extended French, students in Early French Immersion will learn French much more easily and smoothly. They are instructed in 100% French from senior kindergarten to Grade 3. In the first year of senior kindergarten, teacher speaks entirely in French and children response and communicate with each other in English. Then, in the second year, teacher begins to encourage children to speak to him or her in French, but allow children to speak to each other in English. At the end of senior kindergarten, French becomes the exclusive language between the teacher and students and between the children themselves. </p>
<p>There are some inspiration for Chinese bilingual education. Bilingual education thrives in China in past decades. Huge resources have been put into English education on Chinese teenagers. However, the situation is not satisfying. The most frequent use cases of English are still in examinations. Students seldom use English as a tool to communicate with each other. So, it is time to rethink about the English education in China. There are a lot that we can learn from bilingual education of Canada. According to the taxonomy of Canadian bilingual education, most of Chinese institutions treat English as second language, and teach students on an immersion level as Core French. Some bilingual kindergarten in China can cost a lot and is not affordable for normal income family. The teachers who teach English are not native English speakers while teachers in French Immersion Programs in Canada are all native French speakers. So the government should support Early Immersion Programs, covering some part of the cost and increasing the number of English teachers who are native English speakers. Not only the Early Immersion Programs that China are left behind, but also the English education for junior and senior students. The programs in China only teach English as second language while Immersion Programs in Canada also teach other subjects using French as instruction language. It is not viable to copy the program from Canadian Immersion Programs directly, but to find the proper Immersion Program from experiments. As a result of it, some experimental Immersion Programs can be tested and compared to each other and with traditional programs, then find out the most feasible program for Chinese students. The hard work of several generations on English education would make difference on condition that the students start using English in their daily life as a tool but not for examinations. </p>
